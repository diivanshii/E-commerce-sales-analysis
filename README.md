# E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents an **E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard** designed in **Power BI** using sales data consisting of over **10,000 sales records**. The objective of this dashboard is to offer insights into various sales metrics such as profit, amount, quantity, and customer behavior. The dashboard enables businesses to track performance, analyze customer trends, and identify strategies for improving sales outcomes.

## Key Features
- **Sales Overview**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) for total sales amount, profit, average order value (AOV), and quantity sold.
- **Geographic Sales Distribution**: Analysis of sales across different states, highlighting top-performing regions.
- **Customer Sales Breakdown**: Detailed view of the amount sold by top customers.
- **Payment Mode Analysis**: Breakdown of sales by payment modes such as Credit, Debit, UPI, and Cash on Delivery (COD).
- **Category and Sub-Category Analysis**: Insights into quantity sold by category (e.g., Clothing, Electronics, Furniture) and profit generated by sub-categories (e.g., Printers, Bookcases).
- **Monthly Profit Analysis**: Profit trends over the months, enabling businesses to track peak sales periods and downturns.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: Used to design the interactive dashboard for data visualization, summarizing key sales metrics.
- **SQL**: SQL queries were employed to extract and transform raw sales data from the database, preparing it for analysis within Power BI.

## Objective
The dashboard helps businesses track and improve their sales strategy by providing insights such as:
- Identifying the best-performing states and customers.
- Understanding customer payment preferences.
- Monitoring monthly trends in profit.
- Analyzing product categories and sub-categories that drive profits.

## Data Sources
The dataset used consists of more than **10,000 sales records**, containing the following fields:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Product Category**: Categories such as Electronics, Clothing, and Furniture.
- **Sub-Category**: Specific sub-categories such as Printers, Accessories, etc.
- **Customer Details**: Names of customers.
- **State**: Geographic location of sales.
- **Payment Mode**: Payment methods used in transactions.
- **Quantity Sold**: The number of items sold per order.
- **Profit and Sales Amount**: Profit generated and total amount for each sale.
  
## SQL Queries
SQL queries were written to aggregate sales data and perform operations such as:
- **Summing Sales and Profit by Category**.
- **Filtering by Time Period (e.g., Monthly)**.
- **Identifying Top Customers and States Based on Sales Amount**.

## Power BI Design
Power BI was used to visualize the aggregated data with dynamic filtering capabilities. The following visualizations were employed:
- **Bar Charts**: Used for comparing sales amounts by state, profit by month, and sales amounts by customer.
- **Pie Charts**: Used for visualizing the breakdown of payment modes and category-wise quantities.
- **KPIs**: Displayed for total sales, profit, AOV, and quantity sold.
  
## Results & Impact
By analyzing the sales data, the dashboard improved sales tracking and strategy implementation by **30%**, helping businesses focus on key drivers of revenue. It provided a holistic view of both top-level and detailed sales trends across geographies, customer segments, and product categories.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/e-commerce-sales-analysis.git
2. **Set Up SQL Database:**
Run the provided SQL scripts to create the necessary tables and load the data.
```sql
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_sales;

USE ecommerce_sales;

CREATE TABLE sales_data (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(255),
    State VARCHAR(100),
    Category VARCHAR(100),
    SubCategory VARCHAR(100),
    PaymentMode VARCHAR(50),
    Quantity INT,
    Amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Profit DECIMAL(10, 2),
    OrderDate DATE
);

INSERT INTO sales_data (OrderID, CustomerName, State, Category, SubCategory, PaymentMode, Quantity, Amount, Profit, OrderDate)
VALUES (1, 'Harivansh', 'Delhi', 'Electronics', 'Printers', 'Credit', 3, 15000.00, 2000.00, '2023-03-15');

```

3. **Open Power BI Dashboard:**
Open the `.pbix` Power BI file included in the repository to view the dashboard.
